## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and active states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries

### What I learned

I Learnt how to structure my design for responsiveness with media queries and how to structure my html code and my css code to reduce the number of codes in the for readability not perfectly but getting there. Also learnt how to get fonts from the web and implement it in your code.

```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .container {
    margin: 10px;
  }
```

### Continued development

I hope to learn more about the pseudo class and media queries for a more responsive and professional website, would also love to learn how to be able to navigate in the same webpage but different sections.
